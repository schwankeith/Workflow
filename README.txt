SMARTES – Tasker + AutoInput Automation (Option B)

This package gives you a Tasker project that:
- Prompts you for your Spotify link
- Copies it to clipboard
- Opens DailyPlaylists, Soundplate, and Indiemono
- Auto-focuses the first text field and pastes your link
- Tries to tick 'I agree' or 'Terms' checkboxes if visible
- Vibrates if a CAPTCHA shows up so you can solve it

REQUIREMENTS
1) Install Tasker (latest) and AutoInput (plugin) from Play Store.
2) Grant AutoInput Accessibility permission.
3) Make sure your default browser is Chrome (recommended).

IMPORT
1) Share/Copy the .prj.xml to your phone.
2) In Tasker: long-press the 'Home' tab title -> Import -> Select Smartes_Submitter.prj.xml
3) After import, enable the profile(s) if disabled.

RUN
- Open Tasker and tap Tasks -> 'Smartes Submitter' -> ▶ (play) OR add a home-screen shortcut.
- Paste or type your Spotify track link when prompted.
- It will open each site, paste, and try to proceed.
- If CAPTCHA appears, solve it, then continue.

NOTES
- Web pages change; if a field isn't being found, tap the first input once to focus and Tasker will paste automatically on the next step.
- Timing is conservative. If your phone is fast, reduce the Wait times in the task.
- You can edit the selectors inside the AutoInput actions to better match your device/browser.
